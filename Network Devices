Hub:A Central Connection Point
  A hub is a central device that connects multiple computers on a single network. It's essentially a multi-port repeater. Any data packet received by the hub on any port is sent out to all other ports.
  
  Key Characteristics of a Hub:
    Simple: Easy to install and configure.
    Cheap: Generally less expensive than switches.
    Low performance: Due to broadcasting data to all connected devices, network performance can degrade as the number of devices increases.
    Limited functionality: Offers basic connectivity without advanced features like collision detection or data filtering.

Router:Router: The Network Traffic Director
  A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. It operates at the network layer of the OSI model, making decisions about the best path for data to travel. Â  
  
  Key Functions of a Router:
    Packet Forwarding: Directs data packets to their intended destinations based on their IP addresses.
    Network Addressing: Manages IP addresses within a network.
    Routing Protocols: Uses algorithms to determine the best path for data transmission.
    Network Segmentation: Divides a large network into smaller subnets for better management and security.
  Types of Routers:
    Home Routers: Connects home networks to the internet and typically includes a Wi-Fi access point.
    Enterprise Routers: Handles larger networks and complex routing scenarios.
    Core Routers: High-performance routers used in the backbone of large networks.
  How a Router Works:
    A device sends data packets to the router.
    The router examines the packet's destination IP address.
    Using routing tables, the router determines the best path to send the packet.
    The router forwards the packet to the next network hop.

Switch: The Network Traffic Cop
  A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices on a single network. Unlike a hub, it intelligently forwards data packets only to the intended recipient, improving network performance and     efficiency.
  
  Key Characteristics of a Switch:
    Improved performance: By directing data only to the intended device, it reduces network congestion.
    MAC address learning: Switches learn the MAC addresses of connected devices and use this information to forward packets.
    Segmentation: Can divide a network into smaller segments, improving security and performance.
    Types: Managed switches offer advanced configuration options, while unmanaged switches have limited features.
  How a Switch Works:
    A device sends a data packet to the switch.
    The switch examines the packet's destination MAC address.
    If the switch knows the MAC address, it forwards the packet directly to the device.
    If the switch doesn't know the MAC address, it broadcasts the packet to all ports and learns the MAC address.
