Aim:
To configure a network using a server, router, and smart devices in Cisco Packet Tracer, allowing home automation control via a PC.

Components:
i) Router (e.g., 1941) – To act as the main gateway for communication between devices.
ii) Server – To act as the home gateway for managing and controlling smart devices.
iii) Smart Home Devices – Devices like lights, fans, and alarms.
iv) PC – Used for configuring the network and controlling the smart home devices.
v) Wireless Router (optional) – If using wireless smart devices, a wireless router is added to enable connectivity.

Network Design:
The Router connects to a Server that controls the smart devices. The smart devices, including home appliances like lights, fans, and alarms, are connected either through wired or wireless connections. A PC is used to configure the system and access the server for control of the smart appliances.

Step-by-Step Configuration Process:
Step 1: Network Topology Setup
Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
Add the router, server, PC, and smart home appliances.
Use Copper Straight-Through cables to connect the router to the server and PC. For wired smart devices, connect them to the router. Wireless smart devices can connect to the network automatically via a wireless router.
Step 2: Configuring the Router
Access the CLI of the router and configure the router’s interface to connect to the network.
Assign IP addresses to the router interface (e.g., 192.168.10.1).
Optionally, configure DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses to the connected devices.
Step 3: Setting Up the Server
Assign an IP address to the server (e.g., 192.168.10.2).
Enable Home Gateway services on the server to manage smart devices.
Configure the smart devices to communicate with the server using the server's IP address as the IoT gateway.
Step 4: Configuring Smart Devices
Assign IP addresses (static or via DHCP) to the smart devices.
Link each smart device to the server by setting the server’s IP address as their IoT gateway.
Ensure all devices are registered with the server to enable remote control.
Step 5: Configuring the PC
Use the PC to access the server's web interface or IoT control panel.
Through this interface, the PC can control the status of the smart devices, such as turning lights on/off or controlling the fan's speed.
Step 6: Testing and Controlling Devices
Test the network by pinging the server and devices to ensure communication.
From the PC, use the server’s IoT control interface to toggle and manage smart devices.
Outcome:
The setup should allow the PC to remotely control home appliances through the server.
